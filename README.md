This project focuses on solving the **pair question similarity problem** detecting whether two given questions are semantically similar.  
It uses **machine learning / NLP techniques** like Bag of Words (BoW) along with trained models stored as `.pkl` files.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Text preprocessing for similarity detection  
- Bag of Words (BoW) model implementation  
- Trained ML model (`model.pkl`) for predictions - used random forest and xgBoost
- Helper utilities for preprocessing and predictions  
- Ready-to-use application script (`app.py`)
